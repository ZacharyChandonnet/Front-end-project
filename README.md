# Front-end-project
This is my first front end personnal project. Full responsive using HTML CSS GSAP AND JS

# It's a one pager but with a "Work with us", "FAQ" and a "Reservation" page that is available from the footer.

# It was my first time experimenting complex animation both in css and javascript.
  For the JS, i used the GSAP library for my animation and regular js for the FAQ page
  
# I also made the UI/UX myself in adobe XD
